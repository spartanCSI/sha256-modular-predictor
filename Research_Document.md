## Title
A Novel Modular Mapping Approach for Predicting SHA-256 Hash Inputs

## 1. Background
The SHA-256 hashing algorithm is widely regarded as irreversible due to its one-way nature.
This research introduces a groundbreaking method to predict possible inputs from SHA-256 hash outputs using modular mapping.
By simplifying billions of possibilities into a single predictive path, this approach eliminates the need for brute-force computation.

## 2. Research Objectives
1. Develop a simple and fast method to predict SHA-256 hash inputs.
2. Simplify cryptographic reversal into modular mapping.
3. Provide a foundation for advancements in blockchain, cybersecurity, and quantum computing.

## 3. Methodology
- Extract the first 128 bits (32 hexadecimal digits) of the SHA-256 hash.
- Convert to decimal.
- Apply modulo 26000 operation.
- Map the result to letters (a–z) based on specific ranges.
